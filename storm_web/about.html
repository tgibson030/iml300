<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My preferred creative media would be photography or film. I consider myself semi-proficient in PhotoShop and Premiere thanks to past IML courses but I could always use some more practice. I'm hoping to familiarize myself with the rest of the Adobe Creative Cloud and learn more about the web design in this course. The three media applications I probably use the most have to be Instagram, Snapchat and Spotify.</p>
