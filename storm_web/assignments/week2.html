            Creative agency 72 and Sunny's homepage works because it puts the award-winning campaigns center stage without throwing blocks of text and information at the audience. The striking text of the campaign name and the dropshadow descriptions beckon the viewer to browse through the campaigns before looking at the "About" and "Contact" pages. In this way, the text functions like an interface for the page.

        <h3>2. Bad Typography</h3>

            The menu text at the top of the page looks half-finished to me, and the blocks of text and headlines have varying degrees of boldness, which makes it hard to focus on any of the information. This screenshot was taken at 100% zoom and I believe the text could take greater advantage of the space.
