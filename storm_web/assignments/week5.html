            This layout caught my eye with its use of color and a disrupted grid system. It still would have looked good if it was 4x4 blocks all the way down the page, but mixing up the proportions at the top is refreshing and highlights key information. The colored boxes all complement each other in a way that shows some personality without being distracting.

            I interned at the festival this past summer and was always frustrated with the appearance of the website. Unfortunately, it wasnâ€™t really in my jurisdiction to say anything. I believe the site fails to take advantage of space, leaving behind distracting white space and throwing too much text at the viewer. In particular, the gap between the visual and the boxes at the bottom is an awkward no-man's land. Increasing the headlining visual could help, as well as using a tighter, more defined grid system.
